== Introduction ==

It's possible to use PHP itself and also [View Handlers#Serpent] as template language. PHP is useful, if you need best performance in your application or you are not familiar with Serpent.

== Example ==
*Controller code:*
{{{
<?php

class PageController extends GlobalController {
	
	public function run() {
		$data = "<p>Documentation you'll find
                         <a href='http://code.google.com/p/morrowtwo/wiki/Homepage'>here</a>	
		         </p>";
		$this->view->setHandler('Serpent');
		$this->view->setContent($data, "data");
	}
	
}}}

*Template code:*
{{{
~:extend('_index')~

~[body]~
	MorrowTwo Framework is ready :)
	<?= $data; ?>
	
	
	
~[/body]~

}}}


== View properties ==
