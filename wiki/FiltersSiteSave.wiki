= Save =

== Introduction ==

The Save filter just saves the output of the main view as a file.

== Example ==
*Controller code:*
{{{
<?php
// ... Controller code
 
$filename = $this->page->get('alias') . 'alias.html'; 
$this->view->setFilter('save', $filename);
 
// ... Controller code
?>
}}}

Notice that you have to manage the rights permissions for the output file. In this example the output would be set in the root directory. Remember: you'll never want to give writable rights to the root directory of your project. So you could choose another directory for the output :

{{{
<?php

// ... Controller code
// save filter
$directory = 'main/temp/';
$filename = $this->page->get('home') . 'home.htm'; 
$this->view->setFilter('save', $directory . $filename);
 
// ... Controller code
?>
}}}
